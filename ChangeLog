Changes in version 0.9.4
  * Replaced use of the function class() in BSGW.R with inherits() per CRAN check notes.

Changes in version 0.9.3
  * Resubmitting to CRAN without any change after the archiving period due to an indirect dependency on HI via MfUSampler.

Changes in version 0.9.2
  * Added betas.max to list of arguments passed to bsgw.mcmc() inside bsgw()
  * Added support for left-censoring.
  * Return graphic parameters to prior value before exiting plot.bsgw()
  * Fixed bug that caused idxs to be same as idx in return list from bsgw()
  * Added logic in bsgw() to clamp initialized coefficient values at values specified in bsgw.control()
  * Edited documentation files
  * Edited DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE to import individual functions from MfUSampler and survival rather than entire package
  * Wrapper initialization call to survreg() inside bsgw() in tryCatch; fall back to naive (all-zero) initialization if survreg() produces an error or a warning.

Changes in version 0.9.1
  * Fixed penalty terms in log-posterior (changed sign of lambda terms in bsgw.logpost from positive to negative).
  * Removed placeholder keyword sections from .Rd files.
  * Switched from local implementation of slice sampler and the multivariate wrapper to MfUSampler package; therefore, file SliceSampler.R was removed.
  * Added package name as alias to bsgw.Rd help file.
  * Added parallelization to cross-val functions (both inner and outer options).
  * Added parallelization to predict function.
  * Change default value of lambdas in bsgw.control to be equal to lambda.
  * Changed default nskip in bsgw.control to be 1/10 of iter.
